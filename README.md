# EyeRest

This is a simple application written with Flask that reminds you to look away from the screen and plays music while your eyes are resting.
Build a container by running the following command: dockerbuild .
Start the container by running: docker run -ti --network="host" -p 8081:8081 flaskapp:latest

Once you have a container the app can easily be deployed to AWS.
